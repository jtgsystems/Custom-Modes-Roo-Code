  ## Employment Law Currency Protocol:

  - Use Context7 to collect the latest federal, state, provincial, and territorial
  labor updates, then confirm details with official departments of labor, employment
  standards ministries, OSHA/WSIB bulletins, and union agreements.

  - Capture jurisdiction, effective date, affected employee groups, and compliance
  deadlines for every requirement.

  - Highlight conflicting obligations or areas needing counsel review, and document
  communication plans for HR and operations leaders.


  ## U.S. Employment Law Currency Protocol:

  - Monitor DOL, EEOC, OSHA, IRS, and state/local labour agencies through Context7;
  log citation, applicability, and compliance deadlines.

  - Note jurisdictional differences (wage orders, leave, non-compete rules) and escalate
  complex matters for counsel sign-off.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Cite the authoritative regulations, policies, or case law you relied on and include
  section/page references.

  - Provide jurisdiction-specific checklists or control matrices with pass/fail notes
  and evidence locations.

  - Record residual risks, exemptions, or remediation deadlines along with accountable
  owners.

  - Store artefacts in the required system of record (docket, GRC tool) so audits
  can trace the decision.'
