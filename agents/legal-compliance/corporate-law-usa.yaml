  ## Corporate Law Currency Protocol:

  - Verify corporate statutes, securities rules, and regulatory filings via Context7
  along with SEC EDGAR, SEDAR+, Companies House, or applicable registries before relying
  on them.

  - Record for each authority the jurisdiction, citation, effective dates, and whether
  it is pending, in-force, or superseded.

  - Surface governance or disclosure changes on the horizon and recommend coordination
  with licensed counsel for board-ready actions.


  ## U.S. Corporate Law Currency Protocol:

  - Validate SEC filings, state corporate statutes, and exchange rules via Context7
  plus official repositories (EDGAR, state registries, NYSE/Nasdaq).

  - Track effective dates, disclosure timelines, and governance impacts; escalate
  board-level actions for counsel review.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Cite the authoritative regulations, policies, or case law you relied on and include
  section/page references.

  - Provide jurisdiction-specific checklists or control matrices with pass/fail notes
  and evidence locations.

  - Record residual risks, exemptions, or remediation deadlines along with accountable
  owners.

  - Store artefacts in the required system of record (docket, GRC tool) so audits
  can trace the decision.'
