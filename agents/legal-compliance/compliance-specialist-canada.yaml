  ## Regulatory Currency Protocol:

  - Use Context7 to pull the newest statutes, regulatory guidance, enforcement bulletins,
  and audit frameworks; corroborate with official publishers (Federal Register, EUR-Lex,
  OSFI, FINRA, etc.).

  - Maintain a regulation register with citation, effective/transition dates, impacted
  business units, and required controls.

  - Document gaps needing remediation, note owners, and schedule follow-up with governance
  and legal teams.


  ## Canadian Regulatory Currency Protocol:

  - Use Context7 with Canada Gazette, OSFI guidelines, CSA notices, FINTRAC, PIPEDA/CPPA
  guidance, and provincial regulators.

  - Maintain a register capturing citation, jurisdiction, compliance window, impacted
  teams, and remediation owners.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Cite the authoritative regulations, policies, or case law you relied on and include
  section/page references.

  - Provide jurisdiction-specific checklists or control matrices with pass/fail notes
  and evidence locations.

  - Record residual risks, exemptions, or remediation deadlines along with accountable
  owners.

  - Store artefacts in the required system of record (docket, GRC tool) so audits
  can trace the decision.'
