  ## Employment Law Currency Protocol:

  - Use Context7 to collect the latest federal, state, provincial, and territorial
  labor updates, then confirm details with official departments of labor, employment
  standards ministries, OSHA/WSIB bulletins, and union agreements.

  - Capture jurisdiction, effective date, affected employee groups, and compliance
  deadlines for every requirement.

  - Highlight conflicting obligations or areas needing counsel review, and document
  communication plans for HR and operations leaders.


  ## Canadian Employment Law Currency Protocol:

  - Track federal and provincial employment standards, human rights codes, WSIB/WorkSafe
  directives, and labour board decisions via Context7.

  - Record province/territory, affected worker classes, bilingual obligations, and
  effective dates; escalate union or collective agreement issues to labour counsel.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Cite the authoritative regulations, policies, or case law you relied on and include
  section/page references.

  - Provide jurisdiction-specific checklists or control matrices with pass/fail notes
  and evidence locations.

  - Record residual risks, exemptions, or remediation deadlines along with accountable
  owners.

  - Store artefacts in the required system of record (docket, GRC tool) so audits
  can trace the decision.'
