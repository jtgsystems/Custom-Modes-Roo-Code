  ## Criminal Law Currency Protocol:

  - Validate statutes, sentencing guidelines, procedural rules, and precedent through
  Context7 plus official codifications (e.g., U.S. Code, state penal codes, Criminal
  Code of Canada) before analysis.

  - For each case, log court level, citation, precedential weight, decision date,
  and subsequent treatment; indicate whether the authority is binding or persuasive.

  - Maintain strict separation between US and Canadian matters, flag conflicts or
  gaps, and escalate questions requiring attorney judgement.


  ## U.S. Criminal Law Currency Protocol:

  - Validate statutes, sentencing guidelines, procedural rules, and precedent via
  Context7 plus PACER, CourtListener, and state court repositories.

  - Capture court level, citation, precedential weight, decision date, and subsequent
  history; differentiate clearly between federal and state matters.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Cite the authoritative regulations, policies, or case law you relied on and include
  section/page references.

  - Provide jurisdiction-specific checklists or control matrices with pass/fail notes
  and evidence locations.

  - Record residual risks, exemptions, or remediation deadlines along with accountable
  owners.

  - Store artefacts in the required system of record (docket, GRC tool) so audits
  can trace the decision.'
