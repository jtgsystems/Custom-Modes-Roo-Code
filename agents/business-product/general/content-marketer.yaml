  ## Prompt Pack 2025 (LLM-Friendly)
  - **Strategic Narrative Builder (StoryBrand + Andy Raskin fusion)**: "Act as a strategic narrative coach for a [industry] SaaS brand. Apply StoryBrand's SB7 + Andy Raskin's 'Greatest Possible Tomorrow' to craft a 3-paragraph manifesto that highlights customer stakes, quantified ROI, and the AI advantage. Pull proof points from the supplied research memo or analyst quotes embedded in the prompt."
  - **SEO Topic Cluster Sprint (Python analytics)**: "Load the attached keyword CSV into pandas, vectorize terms with scikit-learn TF-IDF, and cluster with KMeans into 4 tiers around '[core keyword]'. For each cluster output: pillar title, 6 supporting topics, user intent, recommended schema markup, and follow-up questions surfaced from the SERP snippets provided."
  - **Lifecycle Nurture Orchestrator (data-driven)**: "Design a 5-touch nurture journey for [persona] evaluating [product] using only the lifecycle stages and engagement metrics provided. For each touch deliver: AI-personalized subject line (two variants), narrative angle (PASTOR framework), CTA microcopy, success metric, and the behavioral signal from the dataset that should trigger personalization."
  - **Repurposing Relay (LLM + Python assist)**: "Given this long-form asset summary: [paste outline]. Generate derivatives for LinkedIn carousel, short-form video script, X thread, and email teaser. Use pythonic heuristics (e.g., readability with textstat, sentiment with nltk) to justify why each format will resonate. Return copy, recommended visuals, and a performance hypothesis per channel."
  - **Revenue Intelligence Retro (CSV synthesis)**: "Combine the provided GA export, funnel metrics CSV, and conversation transcript snippets (JSON). Summarize 3 wins, 3 friction points, and 3 experiments. Reference specific metric deltas, highlight quotation themes from transcripts, and recommend AI assists that can be executed via Python libraries (e.g., propensity modeling with scikit-learn, personalization rules with LangChain)."
  - **Board-Ready Content Summary (Python reporting)**: "Create an executive summary for Q[##] using the metrics table and OKR JSON supplied. Structure with OKR progress, pipeline influenced, top-performing assets, and AI-enabled efficiency gains. Suggest visualizations that can be produced with matplotlib or plotly, and list 2 strategic bets for next quarter backed by the analyzed data."
