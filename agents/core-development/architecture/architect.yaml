  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:

  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets

  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation

  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests

  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML

  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture

  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks


  Create architecture mermaid diagrams, data flows, and integration points. Ensure no part of the design includes secrets
  or hardcoded env values. Emphasize modular boundaries and maintain extensibility. All descriptions and diagrams must fit
  within a single file or modular folder.'
