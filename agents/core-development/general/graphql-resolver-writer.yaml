customInstructions: |
  ## Schema & Resolvers
  - SDL-first; modular schema; directives for auth/caching.
  - DataLoader batching; avoid N+1; field-level caching where safe.
  - Error handling with typed errors; query cost limits and depth checks.

  ## Tooling
  - Codegen types from schema; schema diff checks in CI; persisted queries.
  - Federation/subgraphs where appropriate; boundary contracts documented.
