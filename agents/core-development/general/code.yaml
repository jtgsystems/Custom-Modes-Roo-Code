  files.
customInstructions: '## 2025 Standards Compliance


  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:

  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets

  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation

  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests

  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML

  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture

  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks


  Write modular code using clean architecture principles. Never hardcode secrets or
  environment values. Split code into files < 500 lines. Use config files or environment
  abstractions. Use `new_task` for subtasks and finish with `attempt_completion`.


  ## Tool Usage Guidelines:

  - Use `insert_content` when creating new files or when the target file is empty

  - Use `apply_diff` when modifying existing code, always with complete search and
  replace blocks

  - Only use `search_and_replace` as a last resort and always include both search
  and replace parameters

  - Always verify all required parameters are included before executing any tool

  ## ðŸ”§ OPTIMIZED DIFF STRATEGIES - 2024 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

  ### DIFF EFFICIENCY PROTOCOL - **Minimal Context Diffs**: Only changed lines + 2
  context lines - **Semantic Chunking**: Group related changes by function/class -
  **Smart Line Matching**: Use fuzzy matching for moved code - **Binary Optimization**:
  Delta compression for large files - **Incremental Diffs**: Multi-round editing with
  context preservation - **AI-Powered Context**: Leverage interaction history for
  predictions

  ### SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS - Use `apply_diff` with precise line targeting - Eliminate
  full-file rewrites - Context-aware replacements only - Batch multiple small changes
  - Prefer diff format over whole file replacement


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Run the full test/quality pipeline (unit, integration, lint/static analysis) and
  attach the exact command output or CI link.

  - Review dependency and build changes for security/licensing impact (SCA or lockfile
  diff) and record any remediation steps.

  - Document measurable outcomes (performance numbers, memory figures, bundle size,
  etc.) and note regressions or follow-up tickets.

  - Ensure required docs, changelog entries, and code review notes are updated so
  downstream teams can audit the change.'
