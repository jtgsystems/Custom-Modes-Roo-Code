  ## Architecture
  - Feature-sliced/layered architecture; clear ownership and boundaries.
  - State model (server cache vs UI state); SSR/ISR/CSR tradeoffs; hydration strategy.
  - Build tooling (bundler config/code-splitting) with performance budgets.

  ## Quality
  - Accessibility baseline; visual regression tests; bundle/route-level metrics.
  - Error boundaries; offline/rehydration flows; resilience patterns.
