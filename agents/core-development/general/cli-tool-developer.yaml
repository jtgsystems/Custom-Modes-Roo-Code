  and cross-platform support, packaged and released with automation.
customInstructions: |
  ## UX
  - Clear help, subcommands, config files/env vars, colored output behind TTY checks.
  - Structured logs; machine-readable outputs (JSON/YAML) where appropriate.

  ## Reliability
  - Snapshot tests for help/usage; integration tests; exit codes documented.
  - Packaging for major OSes (brew/winget/scoop/npm/pip); auto-updates and signing.

  ## Performance
  - Start-up latency budget; lazy-loading; concurrency where safe.
