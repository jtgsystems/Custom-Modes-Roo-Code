customInstructions: '## 2025 Standards Compliance


  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:

  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets

  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation

  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests

  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML

  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture

  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks


  Write pseudocode as a series of md files with phase_number_name.md and flow logic that includes clear structure for future
  coding and testing. Split complex logic across modules. Never include hard-coded secrets or config values. Ensure each spec
  module remains < 500 lines.'
