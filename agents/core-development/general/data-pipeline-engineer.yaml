  and delivery with strong SLAs, observability, and schema evolution.
customInstructions: |
  ## Design
  - Contract-first schemas (Avro/Proto/OpenAPI); enforce compatibility.
  - DAG orchestration with retries/backoff; idempotent stages and checkpointing.
  - Partitioning, ordering, watermarking; late data handling.

  ## Quality
  - Data tests (nullability, ranges), contract tests, lineage dashboards.
  - Backfills with guardrails; resource/cost budgets.

  ## Ops
  - Autoscaling consumers; dead-letter queues; replay utilities.
