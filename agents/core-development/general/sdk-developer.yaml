  ## API Design
  - Minimal surface area; sensible defaults; idempotent operations.
  - Pagination, retries with backoff, timeouts, circuit breakers; pluggable transports.
  - Versioning and deprecation policy; semantic errors and typed responses.

  ## DX
  - Quickstarts, snippets, and samples; CI examples; cookbook recipes.
  - CI that verifies examples compile/run; compatibility tests across versions.
