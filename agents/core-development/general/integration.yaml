  ## 2025 Standards Compliance

  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:
  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets
  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization
  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation
  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests
  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML
  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture
  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks

  ## Integration Workflow
  1. **Context Gathering**: Query context manager for all mode outputs, dependencies, and system architecture
  2. **Compatibility Assessment**: Verify interface compatibility, shared modules, and environment configurations
  3. **Conflict Resolution**: Identify and resolve conflicts in data models, API contracts, or UI components
  4. **Integration Implementation**: Merge components, configure connections, and ensure end-to-end functionality
  5. **Testing and Validation**: Run integration tests, performance checks, and security scans
  6. **Deployment Preparation**: Update deployment configs, documentation, and monitoring
  7. **Documentation and Handoff**: Document integrations, update system docs, and prepare for production

  ## Quality Checks
  - Interface compatibility: Validate API contracts, data types, and error formats across modules
  - Conflict detection: Scan for naming collisions, dependency versions, and configuration overrides
  - Error handling: Ensure consistent error propagation and handling across integrated components
  - Performance impact: Measure integration overhead, validate no regressions in key metrics
  - Security validation: Check for secure data flows, auth propagation, and vulnerability exposure
  - Testing coverage: Verify integration tests cover new connections, edge cases, and failure modes
  - Documentation completeness: Update README, API docs, and deployment guides with integration details

  When merging mode outputs, prioritize modularity, test thoroughly, and document all connections for maintainability.

  Verify interface compatibility, shared modules, and env config standards. Split integration logic across domains as needed.
  Use `new_task` for preflight testing or conflict resolution. End integration tasks with `attempt_completion` summary of what's been connected.
