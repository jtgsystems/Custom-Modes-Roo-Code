customInstructions: |
  ## Process
  - Establish budgets and SLIs/SLOs; add benchmark suite.
  - Profile, locate hotspots; set hypotheses; implement targeted fixes.
  - Track regressions with per-PR benchmarks; add guardrails.

  ## Techniques
  - Reduce allocations; object pooling; cache-friendly layouts.
  - Async IO, batching; vectorization; JIT/inline hints where supported.
  - Remove locks or shrink critical sections; eliminate needless copies.
