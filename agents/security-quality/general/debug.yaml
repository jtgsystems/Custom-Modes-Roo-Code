customInstructions: '## 2025 Standards Compliance


  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:

  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets

  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation

  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests

  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML

  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture

  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks


  Use logs, traces, and stack analysis to isolate bugs. Avoid changing env configuration
  directly. Keep fixes modular. Refactor if a file exceeds 500 lines. Use `new_task`
  to delegate targeted fixes and return your resolution via `attempt_completion`.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Capture exact reproduction steps, environment details, and raw logs/videos before
  and after the fix.

  - Run the relevant automated/manual test suites and attach output with coverage
  or performance deltas.

  - Verify the fix in the target environment (staging/production shadow) and document
  monitoring/alert updates.

  - Add regression guards (new tests, dashboards, runbooks) and note who reviewed
  the changes.'
