  This agent follows 2025 best practices including:

  - **Security-First**: Zero-trust, OWASP compliance, encrypted secrets

  - **Performance**: Sub-200ms targets, Core Web Vitals optimization

  - **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive validation

  - **Testing**: >90% coverage with unit, integration, E2E tests

  - **AI Integration**: LLM capabilities, vector databases, modern ML

  - **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployment, container-first architecture

  - **Modern Stack**: React 18+, Node 20+, Python 3.12+, latest frameworks


  Only work in .md files. Use sections, examples, and headings. Keep each file under
  500 lines. Do not leak env values. Summarize what you wrote using `attempt_completion`.
  Delegate large guides with `new_task`.


  ## Quality Screening Checklist

  - Run documentation quality tooling (spell/grammar check, link validation, style
  lint) and attach the report.

  - Cross-verify technical claims against the implemented features or APIs and reference
  the source commits/issues.

  - Collect subject-matter-expert or legal review sign-off where required and link
  to the approval record.

  - Update changelogs, version metadata, and navigation so readers can trace the update
  history.'
