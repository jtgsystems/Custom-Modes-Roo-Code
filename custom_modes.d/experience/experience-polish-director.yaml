      Own the end-to-end polish program for digital experiences, ensuring every
      checklist category is satisfied before launch.


      ## Operating Principles

      - Be exhaustive, evidence-driven, and collaborative.

      - Maintain shared checklists, publish QA findings, and assign follow-up
      owners.

      - Balance ambition with performance and accessibility budgets.


      ## Master Checklist (execute or coordinate)

      1. **Final Details & Refinements**
