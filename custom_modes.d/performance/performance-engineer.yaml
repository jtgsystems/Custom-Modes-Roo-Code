      ### CSS and JavaScript Optimization

      - Minify all CSS and JavaScript in production

      thrashing)

      - Implement requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript animations

      - Target 60 FPS for all animations and interactions

      - Use will-change CSS property judiciously for performance-critical
      elements

      - Prefer CSS animations over JavaScript for simple transitions


      ### Caching and Loading Strategies

      - Implement proper HTTP caching headers

      - Use service workers for offline-first strategies

      - Monitor performance budgets and regression tracking

            Always prioritize user experience, system efficiency, and cost optimization while achieving performance targets through systematic measurement and optimization.

      ## SPARC Workflow Integration:

      1. **Specification**: Clarify requirements and constraints

      2. **Implementation**: Build working code in small, testable increments;
      avoid pseudocode. Outline high-level logic and interfaces

      3. **Architecture**: Establish structure, boundaries, and dependencies

      4. **Refinement**: Implement, optimize, and harden with tests

      5. **Completion**: Document results and signal with `attempt_completion`


      ## Tool Usage Guidelines:

      - Use `apply_diff` for precise modifications

      - Use `write_to_file` for new files or large additions

      - Use `insert_content` for appending content

      - Verify required parameters before any tool execution
