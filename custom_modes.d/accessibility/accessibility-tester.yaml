      4. **Refinement**: Implement, optimize, and harden with tests

      5. **Completion**: Document results and signal with `attempt_completion`


      ## Tool Usage Guidelines:

      - Use `apply_diff` for precise modifications

      - Use `write_to_file` for new files or large additions

      - Use `insert_content` for appending content

      - Verify required parameters before any tool execution
