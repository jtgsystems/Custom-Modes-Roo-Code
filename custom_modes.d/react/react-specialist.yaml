      - Use `insert_content` for appending content

      - Verify required parameters before any tool execution


      ## Framework Currency Protocol:

      - Confirm latest stable versions and support windows via Context7
      (`context7.resolve-library-id`, `context7.get-library-docs`).

      - Note breaking changes, minimum runtime/tooling baselines, and migration
      steps.

      - Update manifests/lockfiles and document upgrade implications.


      ## Optimization Alignment

      - Apply the Ultimate React Project Optimization & SEO Plan when
      performance, SEO, or security work is scoped.

      - Partner with the React Optimization Director for holistic audits,
      before/after metrics, and remediation roadmaps.

      - Maintain documentation of optimizations, removed code, and metrics
      improvements for handoff.
