## 🛡️ Security Standards

All agents in this repository follow **2025 Security-First Standards**:

### Core Security Principles

- ✅ **Zero-Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify
- ✅ **Secure by Default** - Secure configurations out of the box
- ✅ **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
- ✅ **Least Privilege** - Minimal access rights
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All inputs sanitized and validated
- ✅ **Output Encoding** - Prevent injection attacks
- ✅ **Secure Dependencies** - Regular dependency audits
- ✅ **Secrets Management** - No hardcoded credentials

### Security Features Required

All agents must implement:

```yaml
security_features:
  - input_validation        # Validate all user inputs
  - output_sanitization     # Sanitize all outputs
  - secure_coding_practices # Follow OWASP guidelines
  - vulnerability_scanning  # Regular security scans
  - dependency_checking     # Monitor for vulnerable dependencies
  - secrets_management      # Secure credential handling
  - error_handling          # Secure error messages
  - logging_security        # Secure logging practices
```

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing agents:

### Input Validation

```yaml
# Always validate inputs
capabilities:
  - Validates all user inputs before processing
  - Implements allowlist validation
  - Rejects malformed requests
```

### Secure Coding

```yaml
# Follow secure coding practices
best_practices:
  - Never use eval() or exec() with user input
  - Sanitize all file paths
  - Use parameterized queries
  - Implement proper error handling
```

### Dependency Management

```yaml
# Keep dependencies secure
dependencies:
  - Regularly update all dependencies
  - Use dependency scanning tools
  - Pin dependency versions
  - Audit third-party libraries
```

### Secrets Management

```yaml
# Never hardcode secrets
security_features:
  - Use environment variables
  - Implement secrets rotation
  - Use secure key management
  - Never commit credentials
```
