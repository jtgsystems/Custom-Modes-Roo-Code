# Custom Roo Code Modes 🚀

Welcome to the **Custom Roo Code Modes** repository! 🎉 This project serves as a central place to store, manage, and share custom mode definitions for the [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) AI agent within Visual Studio Code.

## 🌟 Overview

Roo Code utilizes specialized AI "modes" or personas to tackle different development tasks. This repository contains a curated collection of these mode definitions, primarily stored in the `custom_modes.json` file. By maintaining these definitions here, we can version control, share, and collaboratively refine the capabilities of various AI assistants used in the Roo Code workflow.

### Key Goals 🎯
- **Centralized Mode Management**: Provide a single source of truth for custom Roo Code mode configurations.
- **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Define specialized roles and detailed instructions to improve AI performance on specific tasks (e.g., frontend development, SEO, content strategy).
- **Workflow Optimization**: Tailor AI assistants to specific project needs and best practices.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitate sharing and improvement of mode definitions within a team or community.
- **Self-Correction Tracking**: Log errors and corrections applied to modes over time in `botcorrections.json`.

## ✨ Mode Examples Included

This repository contains definitions for various modes, including (but not limited to):

### 🤖 Standard Development Modes
- **`full-stack-developer`**: Expert in comprehensive web application development
- **`frontend-developer`**: Specialist in creating modern web interfaces
- **`devops-engineer`**: Infrastructure automation and deployment expert
- **`content-strategist`**: SEO-aware content creation and strategy
- **`seo-specialist`**: Comprehensive on-page and technical SEO optimization
- **`compliance-specialist`**: Regulatory adherence and risk management

### 🚀 NEW: Claude Code ULTRON Mode
- **`claude-code-ultron`**: Elite software engineer with MCP orchestration capabilities
  - **25+ Department Organization**: Structured workspace with SECURITY, OPERATIONS, DEVELOPMENT
  - **12+ MCP Tools**: Unified Thinking (33 frameworks), Research, Image Processing, etc.
  - **Performance Optimization**: 2-50x speed improvements with parallel processing
  - **Security Integration**: KEYHOLDER scanning, VAULT credential management
  - **Auto-Launch Systems**: Session start protocols and health monitoring
  - **Military-Grade Discipline**: Systematic automation and precision execution

### 📋 Project Management Modes
- **`product-owner`**: End-to-end project management and client engagement
- **`software-architect`**: Scalable MVP architecture design
- **`tech-lead`**: Task decomposition and technical specification
- **`full-stack-implementer`**: Modular, production-ready implementation
- **`code-monkey`**: Rapid development following tech lead guidance

Each mode definition includes:
- `slug`: A unique identifier.
- `name`: A human-readable name.
- `roleDefinition`: Describes the AI's persona and expertise.
- `customInstructions`: Detailed protocols and guidelines the mode should follow, including self-correction mandates.
- `groups`: Specifies the tool capabilities assigned to the mode (e.g., `read`, `edit`, `command`, `mcp`).

## 🛠️ Usage

To use these custom modes with your Roo Code VS Code extension:

1.  **Locate Roo Code Storage:** Find the Roo Code global storage directory. On Windows, this is typically:
    ```
    C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code - Insiders\\User\\globalStorage\\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\\settings\\
    ```
    *(Adjust the path if you use the stable version of VS Code or a different operating system)*.

2.  **Copy Configuration:** Copy the appropriate `custom_modes.json` file from this repository into the `settings` directory found in step 1, replacing the existing file if necessary.

3.  **Restart VS Code:** Restart Visual Studio Code to ensure Roo Code loads the new mode definitions.

4.  **Select Mode:** You should now be able to select and use the custom modes defined in this repository within the Roo Code interface.

- **Parallel Processing**: Maximum CPU utilization

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you improve an existing mode or create a new useful one, feel free to submit a Pull Request. Please ensure:

- The JSON format is valid.
- Instructions are clear and follow the established pattern (including Information Verification and Self-Correction clauses).
- The `botcorrections.json` file is updated if the changes stem from a logged correction.
- Performance optimization protocols are included for development modes.
- Security considerations are addressed for modes handling sensitive operations.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When using modes that handle sensitive data or operations:

- Always use VAULT system for credential management
- Run KEYHOLDER security scans before commits
- Follow department naming conventions (CAPITALS for department names)
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use parallel processing for performance optimization
