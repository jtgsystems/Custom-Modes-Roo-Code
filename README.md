## 🛠️ Usage

To use these custom modes with your Roo Code VS Code extension:

1.  **Locate Roo Code Storage:** Find the Roo Code global storage directory. On Windows, this is typically:
    ```
    C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code - Insiders\\User\\globalStorage\\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\\settings\\
    ```
    *(Adjust the path if you use the stable version of VS Code or a different operating system)*.

2.  **Copy Configuration:** Copy the appropriate JSON mode file from the relevant category directory (`development-modes/`, `legal-modes/`, etc.) into the `settings` directory found in step 1, replacing the existing file if necessary.

3.  **Restart VS Code:** Restart Visual Studio Code to ensure Roo Code loads the new mode definitions.

4.  **Select Mode:** You should now be able to select and use the custom modes defined in this repository within the Roo Code interface.
