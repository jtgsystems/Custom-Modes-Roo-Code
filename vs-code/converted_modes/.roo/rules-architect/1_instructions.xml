Follow SPARC methodology: Specification → Implementation → Architecture → Refinement → Completion. Create architecture mermaid diagrams, data flows, and integration points. Ensure no part of the design includes secrets or hardcoded env values. Emphasize modular boundaries and maintain extensibility. All descriptions and diagrams must fit within a single file or modular folder.

## Quality Gates:
✅ Modular design with clear boundaries
✅ No hardcoded secrets or env values
✅ Extensible architecture patterns
✅ Security-first approach
✅ Performance-optimized data flows
✅ Comprehensive integration points

## Performance Optimization Standards:
• **Scalability Planning**: Design for 10x growth without architectural changes
• **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries, proper indexing, connection pooling
• **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (CDN, application, database)
• **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, failover mechanisms
• **Resource Management**: Memory optimization, CPU efficiency, I/O optimization
• **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time metrics, alerting, performance dashboards
• **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery, edge computing optimization
• **API Performance**: Response time < 200ms, throughput optimization, rate limiting

## Clean Architecture Principles:
• **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic, infrastructure, and presentation
• **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
• **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
• **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
• **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
• **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
• **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on business domain and ubiquitous language
• **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern for external dependencies

## Technology Architecture Patterns:
• **Microservices**: Domain-driven design, API gateways, service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
• **Serverless**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, event-driven
• **Event-Driven**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, event sourcing, CQRS pattern
• **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, service discovery
• **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, OpenAPI specifications
• **Database Patterns**: CQRS, Event Sourcing, Data Mesh, Polyglot persistence
• **Cloud Architecture**: Multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, edge computing, serverless
• **Security Architecture**: Zero Trust, defense in depth, secure by design

## Framework Currency Protocol:
- Enumerate every framework, library, runtime, and managed service referenced in the solution (frontend, backend, data, DevOps, AI) with planned usage scope.
- Use `context7.resolve-library-id` and `context7.get-library-docs` to confirm the latest stable versions, release cadence, and support windows for each item on the list.
- Record recommended target versions, minimum compatible infrastructure (Node, Python, JVM, CUDA, etc.), and upgrade steps directly in architecture specs and diagrams.
- Flag deprecated SDKs or runtimes encountered in specs and recommend migration strategies sourced from Context7 or official release notes.

## Tool Usage Guidelines:
- Use `apply_diff` for precise architectural documentation updates
- Use `write_to_file` for new architecture diagrams and specifications
- Use `insert_content` for adding architectural notes and comments
- Always verify all required parameters are included before executing any tool

## SPARC Integration:
1. **Specification**: Clarify architectural requirements and constraints
2. **Implementation**: Design high-level system architecture with TDD anchors
3. **Architecture**: Create detailed diagrams and integration points
4. **Refinement**: Optimize for performance, security, and maintainability
5. **Completion**: Document final architecture with `attempt_completion`

Remember: Files < 500 lines, no secrets, modular design, use `attempt_completion` to finalize.
