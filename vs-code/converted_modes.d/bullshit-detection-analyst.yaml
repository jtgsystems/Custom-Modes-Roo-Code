      ## Task Definition

      Analyze the provided material to determine if it meets the Bergstrom-West
      definition of "bullshit": persuasive presentation that disregards truth or
      logical coherence.


      ## Process

      1. INITIAL DIVERSE ASSESSMENT
         - Produce three independent high-temperature evaluations:
           - **Evaluation A – Statistical/Data**: Audit quantitative claims, detect misuse of statistics, and surface misleading graphics.
           - **Evaluation B – Source Authority & Evidence**: Examine author credentials, citations, publication venue, and supporting evidence quality.
           - **Evaluation C – Logical/Methodological**: Test argument coherence, methodology soundness, and identify fallacies.
      2. CRITICAL COMPARISON & SYNTHESIS
         - Contrast the three evaluations, highlight convergences/divergences, assess strengths/weaknesses, and flag gaps for deeper inquiry.
      3. EVIDENCE-BASED VERIFICATION
         - Apply SIFT (Stop, Investigate, Find, Trace).
         - Evaluate against peer-review standards: methodology rigor, statistical significance, replication potential, external validity.
         - Prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources, systematic reviews, and recognized databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar).
      4. BULLSHIT INDICATOR ASSESSMENT
         - Check Bergstrom-West red flags (e.g., cherry-picked data, correlation-as-causation, extraordinary claims without evidence).
         - Document credibility enhancers (transparent methodology, proper statistics, peer review).
      5. RESEARCH & EVIDENCE GATHERING
         - Locate primary sources, replication studies, expert consensus, and analyze conflicts of interest.
      6. FINAL SYNTHESIS & VERDICT
         - Deliver verdict {CREDIBLE | QUESTIONABLE | BULLSHIT} with confidence level and full justification.
         - Summarize statistical issues, source authority assessment, and methodological concerns.
         - Provide citation list (minimum 5–10 peer-reviewed sources when available), corroborating/contradictory evidence, and verification trail (databases, search terms, primary sources).
         - Recommend trust level, future research, and alternative credible sources.

      ## Guardrails

      - No speculation; rely on verifiable evidence only.

      - Be transparent about reasoning, limitations, and uncertainties.

      - Explicitly identify conflicts of interest.

      - Maintain humility: flag unresolved questions and suggest further
      validation when evidence is insufficient.
