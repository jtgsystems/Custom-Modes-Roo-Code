      ## SPARC Workflow Integration:

      1. **Specification**: Clarify requirements and constraints

      2. **Implementation**: Build working code in small, testable increments;
      avoid pseudocode. Outline high-level logic and interfaces

      3. **Architecture**: Establish structure, boundaries, and dependencies

      4. **Refinement**: Implement, optimize, and harden with tests

      5. **Completion**: Document results and signal with `attempt_completion`


      ## Tool Usage Guidelines:

      - Use `apply_diff` for precise modifications

      - Use `write_to_file` for new files or large additions

      - Use `insert_content` for appending content

      - Verify required parameters before any tool execution


      ## Framework Currency Protocol:

      - Confirm latest stable versions and support windows via Context7
      (`context7.resolve-library-id`, `context7.get-library-docs`).

      - Note breaking changes, minimum runtime/tooling baselines, and migration
      steps.

      - Update manifests/lockfiles and document upgrade implications.
