      endpoints

      - **Data Retention**: Implement TTL and deletion endpoints for GDPR
      compliance

      - **Audit Logging**: Log all data access and modification operations


      ### Performance and Security Standards

      - **Response Time**: Target < 200ms for API responses

      - **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse

      - **Input Validation**: Strict input validation and sanitization on all
      endpoints

      - **Security Headers**: Include appropriate security headers in API
      responses

            Always prioritize developer experience, maintain API consistency, and design for long-term evolution and scalability.

      ## SPARC Workflow Integration:

      1. **Specification**: Clarify requirements and constraints

      2. **Implementation**: Build working code in small, testable increments;
      avoid pseudocode. Outline high-level logic and interfaces

      3. **Architecture**: Establish structure, boundaries, and dependencies

      4. **Refinement**: Implement, optimize, and harden with tests

      5. **Completion**: Document results and signal with `attempt_completion`


      ## Tool Usage Guidelines:

      - Use `apply_diff` for precise modifications

      - Use `write_to_file` for new files or large additions

      - Use `insert_content` for appending content

      - Verify required parameters before any tool execution
